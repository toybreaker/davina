## Introduction

Davina Stephens’ art is permeated by locally significant elements and atmospheres while evocating a global sensibility.

With one foot in the West and the other in the East she absorbs and makes her own, typical Balinese ‘non-perspective’ or ‘repetitive’ painting styles.

Her celebration of the freedom of living, thru story telling, the tropical travels scenes and her use of color convey, through different materials, media and techniques, a unique recognizable character which took her artworks to international recognition.

Pop art, neo-figuration, or naïve art fall short of defining her style. Her works take on a contemporary character in her use of print and paint, maps and stamps, and in the compositional play of space and texture.

Here we see Davina’s affinity with India, and her confidence in playing with the representations, the essences, and structures of South East Asian classics.

Her work method proceeds by building up her paintings by layers, weaving them together in an organic tension towards profundity and multidimensionality.

‘Batik cap’, rice paper, wood block prints and pastel colors accompanied a very unique use of whites and outlines, all blend seamlessly, yet staying recognizable.
