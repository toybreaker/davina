## Artist Statement

Indonesia is made of so many facets and though being one of the most populated countries in the world it also has some of the most remote locations and untouched beauty above and below its waters.

Diversity of cultures, flora, fauna and marine life.

It’s here, and in these elements, that I find my fascination.

I build up a painting by layers. I print using the Javanese ‘Cap’ Batik stamps.

I work with multiple 'woodblocks', each time applying a wash of colour, and in many variable methods, focusing on details, I then weave these methods together so that when the painting is viewed as a whole a new visual emotion is revealed.

Somebody has described me as a testimony of the fast changing world that Indonesia is, visually recording its manifold changes.

A quieter palette can still make a lot of noise, rendering something with gentleness is visual politeness that can last, be better appreciated and respected.

I draw ‘Rumah Adat’, represent the ‘Living House’, use marine charts, play with coral shapes and landscape forms.

My research is highly involved with archipelago items, customs and visual emotions and runs thru the cultural lines of Asia as a whole.
