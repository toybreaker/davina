    <p>We pride ourselves on making our guests feel like home. 20 years floating around the archipelago has enabled us to create a comfortable, cool environment on board so you can leave your world behind, and start a life changing experience from the moment you reach Padang, Sumatra, and set sail to the islands.

    <p>Poti, David are early archipelago pioneers, they have travelled thoroughly and know every nook and cranny of Mentawai, Telo and Nias Islands. </p>

    <p>Be sure they will make the best possible call regarding the potential surf during your adventure. Our roster of guides are also super experienced, surf starved who will make sure you score.</p>

    <p>We are fluent in French, English, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, Portuguese.</p>

    <p>Our captains Yunus and Anugrah and chefs Edu and our crew Bandy, Nonon, Done, Oyong, Agung and Son are awesome Indonesian locals, who will make sure you will not forget your time with us.</p>

      <p>"It was my 15th trip in the Mentawai and Poti is one of the sickest captain I've had. Really helpful and always at the good spot!!! This is what you're looking for when you're on a photoshoot and the surfers were really stoked too, which make the perfect combination, work and fun" <span class="quote_author">Alex Laurel, Freelance filmer and photographer</span> </p>
