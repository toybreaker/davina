### JET-SKI
{:.center}

The jet-ski will be used to get closer to the breaks, for photographers and film-makers and for short cruises near the boat.

Only the guide can authorize jet-ski use, depending on sea and weather conditions.
Unless the client is a seasoned jet-ski user, by the guide standards, it will not be used individually.

Tow-in: the guides will decide in which spot jet-ski can be used depending on crowds and safety for all.
